const App = () => {
  const handleSuccess = () => {
    alert('Cheat code activated! üöÄ');
  };

  const handleFail = () => {
    alert('Cheat code failed! ‚ùå');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Use the arrow keys to enter the cheat code</h1>
      <CheatCode
        cheatCode={cheatCode}
        onSuccess={handleSuccess}
        onFail={handleFail}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Options

`CheatCode` component accepts the following props:

- `cheatCode`: An array of directions (e.g., `['up', 'down']`) representing the cheat code sequence.
- `onSuccess`: Function triggered when the cheat code is entered correctly.
- `onFail`: Optional function triggered when the cheat code fails.

### Example with Timeout

To add a timeout between inputs:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import CheatCode from 'react-cheatcode-generator';

const cheatCode = ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right'];

const App = () => {
  const handleSuccess = () => {
    alert('Cheat code activated! üöÄ');
  };

  const handleFail = () => {
    alert('Cheat code failed! ‚ùå');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Use the arrow keys to enter the cheat code</h1>
      <CheatCode
        cheatCode={cheatCode}
        onSuccess={handleSuccess}
        onFail={handleFail}
        timeoutDuration={1000} // 1 second timeout between inputs
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
